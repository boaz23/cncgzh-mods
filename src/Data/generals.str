"Jarmen Kell, Col. Burton and Black Lotus can be invaluable to your strategy. These heroes can turn the tide of a battle and are invisible to the enemy. To locate your hero on the radar, look for the cross hair icon. Though you can only build one at a time don't underestimate their importance."

academy:buildmorepeons

END

academy:buildsupplycenterearlier

It will be money well spent and will help you achieve victory."

"Supplies are the name on the game, General. They can be gathered at Supply Docks littered around the battlefield. While one dock may be enough early on it's usually best to branch out and find a few more during a mission.

END

academy:ranoutofpower
"While the GLA has no need for power, China and the USA eat it up like popcorn. To keep a base running strong a General needs to spend money on plenty of power to supply the war machine.

"General, acquiring supplies later in a mission can be difficult. Each faction has a unique way to gain funds during long battles. China can build Hackers and an Internet Center. You can direct the Hackers to hack the internet for funds anywhere or just send them inside Internet Center to gain money even quicker. The GLA depends on the Black Market and the USA relies on the Supply Drop. If you don't plan ahead you may have shortages."

If you tap \"E\" twice quickly it will select all the same type across the entire battlefield. \"Q\" will select all your combat units on the map. \"W\" will select all your air units on the map. Give them a try, they'll help you out."

Simply build a few Tunnel Networks and send your units inside. Click on the structure and you can expel them from any other Tunnel Network anywhere on the map. They are key to the overall GLA strategy."
